# Escape the Valley
## Story
This is a creepy spin off game of Stardew Valley. The player inherits a farm from their grandfather due to his death, but after living in Pelican Town for a bit, the player notices something is... off. The villagers all seem pretty cheerful on the outside, but what disturbing secrets are they hiding? They all have their own lives with unique personalities and backgrounds. Learn about them, their family and friends, and find out what living in Pelican Town is like for them. Maybe you'll even find information about your grandfather's death... 

## About the Gameplay
This will be a text-based game. The game will start the player off in their farmhouse on the first day of Spring, which also happens to be their first day living there. There might be elements of a visual novel, but the visuals will be from images converted to text. The player can make 1 decision for each hour of the day, starting at 6am and ending at 2am, for a total of 20 main hour decisions. Some decisions might branch off into other event based decisions. The scope of this game is undetermined. It can be incredibly complex given all the different characters and the elements of a new story, but the extent of initial development will allow for the player to get through all of Spring 1.

## Beating the Game
The game will end when the player is able to successfully leave Pelican Town, AKA when the player has donated enough money to unlock the bus repair. They also need to convince Pam to help them escape.

## Extra Plot
The player will be able to finish the community center for an extra plot line about the Junimos. The player will also be able to romance a character and convince them to leave Pelican Town together. This unlocks their post-8 heart events, and the player will require 10 hearts with that character to be able to leave with them.

## Development
This will be done in C++. I will use the Stardew Valley Wiki for reference while creating original story content. I will use a image to text converter for the villagers portraits when engaging in dialogue with them. I want to create a website along with this game, where the player can log their interactions with the villagers to track how many hearts they have with them.

## Included Elements
This will have a much more watered down amount of elements, partially due to scope but also due to limitations of being text-based. Here is what I will try include for Spring 1:  
* The Farmer
* Crops
* Sprinklers
* Seasons
* Festivals
* Villagers
* Community center bundles
* The animals (starting with horse)
* The buildings
* Tools
* Fish
* Currency (gold)
* Resources (starting with wood and stone)
* Shops
* Locations
* Residences
